# EIC-Insurance-Dashboard---Power-BI-Project
This project showcases an interactive Power BI dashboard built for a fictional insurance company EIC, analyzing insurance policies, premiums, and claims data over five years (2014â€“2018). The dashboard helps identify policyholder demographics, high-claim segments, and premium trends for better business decisions.
